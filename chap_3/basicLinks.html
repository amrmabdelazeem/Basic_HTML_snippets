    <h1>Some of my Favorite sites</h1>
    <h2>Wikipedia</h2>
    <p>one of my favorite web sites is called <a href=
    ""http://www.wikipedia.org">wikipedia.</a>
    This terrific site allows ordinary users to enter
    encyclopedia definitions. Over time, the entries
    can be as reliable as a commercial encyclopedia,
    and a lot more complete.

    <p>You can find out a lot about upcoming and current
 Dummies books at <a href= "http://www.dummies.com">
