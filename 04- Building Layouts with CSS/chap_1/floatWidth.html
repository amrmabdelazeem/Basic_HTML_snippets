    <h1>Specifying the width</h1>
    <p>
        Paragraph 1.
        This paragraph has the normal behavior of a block-level element.
        It takes up the entire width of the page, and the next element
        is placed underneath.
    </p>
    <p class = "floated">
        Paragraph 2.
        This paragraph is floated left. It is placed to the left, and the
        next element will be placed to the right of it.
    </p>
     <p>
    Paragraph 3.
    This paragraph has no floating, width or margin. It takes whatever
    space it can to the right of the floated element, and then flows
    to the next line.
    </p>
